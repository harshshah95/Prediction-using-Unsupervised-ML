# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML 
#### This project uses K-means algorithm clustering.

Step 1: Import libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. Read the CSV data file. Calculate the Within cluster sum of squares, plot a elbow graph and select the number of clusters.

Step 2: Fit the model and predict using Kmeans.

Step 3: Plot a scatter graph for the clusters.
